/**
 * binary_tree_preorder - Goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal
 * @tree: Pointer to the root node of the tree to traverse
 * @func: Pointer to a function to call for each node's value
 *
 * Description: Pre-order traversal starts from the root node and visits the
 * parent node before its children (left subtree, right subtree).
 * The value in each node is passed as a parameter to the function 'func'.
 * If tree or func is NULL, do nothing.
